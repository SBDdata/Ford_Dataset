## Dataset

> The dataset has 183412 rows and 16 columns. The dataset generally shows the duration of the trip, the start and end station id's & longitude and latitude.
The type of user and the gender are also noted.
We have some quantitative data, the ID's should all be treated as nominal data (qualitative data). The longitude and latitude can be treated as numeric data for the purpose for any calculations.


## Summary of Findings

## Conclusions

- It is obvious that there is a great difference between the user types. The majority of the users are subcribers and thats good to know (assuming subscribers have subscriptions and are not one time clients). 

- This shows that most trips were taken during the middle of the week especially on Thursdays. Of particular interest is the fact that the least trips were taken on weekends

- Its interesting to note that Males take far more trips that Females. This insight is something the company should investigate to drive up the numbers of females.

- As expected the highest number of trips is for the age range 21-40.For Below 20, the count is low mainly beacuse the number of trips for that range is very low complained to the others. As expectd the elderly people (avove 60) have the lowest count

- For the violin plot, generally 80% of the trips are below 15 mins. Customers tend to have longer bike trip durations than subscribers. Most customers had trips between 5-15 mins while most subsribers had trips between 2 - 12 mins

- For the box plot shows the median displacement between the two plots. The customer distribution has a higher median for the duration of trips than the Subsciber distribution. Its also import to notice that both distributions have a lot of outliers

- generally most of the trips are below 15mins.The '21-40' distribution has the most curve and that is where the bulk of the trips lie.The above '60' distribution has the smallest curve and that is where the least of the trips lie

- The median displacement between the four plots. Unexpectedly, the 'Above 60' distribution has the highest median displacement. Its also import to notice that both distributions have a lot of outliers

- For all gender groups the customers have longer trip durations than the subscribers.

- For all gender groups the customers have longer trip durations than the subscribers.

- Most of the trips were between 2 am to 4 am for customers.Most of the trips were between 2 am to 4 am for subcribers.
